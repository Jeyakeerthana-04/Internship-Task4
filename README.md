# DESCRIPTION

This repository contains the complete solution for Internship Task 4, developed as part of a structured data science internship program. The main objective of this task is to build and evaluate a machine learning model for regression analysis using Python. The task involves working with a numerical dataset where the goal is to predict continuous target values by applying suitable regression algorithms. The implementation includes all the essential steps of a typical machine learning workflow: data loading, preprocessing, feature selection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, prediction, and performance evaluation.

The notebook leverages powerful Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data handling, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for applying and evaluating machine learning models. The process begins with understanding the structure of the dataset and cleaning it by handling null values, removing irrelevant features, and applying transformations as needed. EDA is performed to gain insights into the data patterns, distributions, and correlations. After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, and one or more regression models—such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, or Random Forest Regressor—are trained and fine-tuned.

The model’s effectiveness is evaluated using appropriate metrics for regression tasks such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score. Throughout the notebook, each step is clearly documented with code comments and output visuals, making the project easy to understand even for beginners. The task provides hands-on experience with regression modeling and demonstrates how to handle real-world numeric data problems.

This project is especially useful for students, aspiring data scientists, or interns looking to strengthen their understanding of supervised machine learning in the context of regression. It can also serve as a strong portfolio project that highlights practical skills in data preprocessing, regression modeling, and performance evaluation. Users can download or clone the repository, run the notebook in a Jupyter environment, and experiment with different models or parameters to improve prediction accuracy.

The solution is structured in a clean and organized way, with a focus on readability and reproducibility. Anyone interested in learning how to apply machine learning to predict continuous outcomes will find this notebook valuable. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome and encouraged.
